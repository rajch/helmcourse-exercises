## Requirements

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://rajware.github.io/helmcourse-exercises | common | 0.1.0 |
| https://rajware.github.io/helmcourse-exercises | db(mysql) | 0.2.1 |

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| db ||| db provides access to the embedded MySQL |
| db.password | string | `"anything"` | password is the MySQL root user password |
| db.secretKey | string | `nil` | secretKey is the name of a key in a secret object.  If secretKey is specified, but not secretName, the chart will  create a Secret called {{ .Release.Name}}-mysql-sec, and store  the password in a key with this name. If secretName is also specified, the chart will look for a key with this name in a Secret with that name. |
| db.secretName | string | `nil` | secretName is name of an existing secret object. If specified, the chart will look for a Secret with this name, and a key in it with the name specified in secretKey. If it can't find it, the chart will fail. If secretName is specified, but not  secretKey, it will be ignored. |
| db.storageCapacity | string | `"2Gi"` | storageCapacity is the minimum capacity for MySQL data storage |
| db.storageClassName | string | `nil` | storageClassName is the StorageClass used for the MySQL PVC |
| dbServiceName | string | `nil` | dbServiceName allows us to provide a name for the service that Adminer will be configured to connect to by default. It is used only if MySQL is not included by setting tags.include-db to  false, ignored otherwise. If it is used, it cannot be empty. |
| service ||| service provides properties to control the service that exposes Adminer |
| service.nodePort | string | `nil` | nodePort specifies the NodePort to be used to expose Adminer. If left blank, a random port will be chosen by Kubernetes |
| service.type | string | `"NodePort"` | type can be NodePort or LoadBalancer |
| tags ||| tags allows us to control inclusion of subcharts |
| tags.include-db | bool | `true` | include-db specifies if the mysql sub-chart will be included |
| tags.include-np | bool | `true` | include-np specifies if a network policy will be included |
